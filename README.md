# Neu.ro helm charts

[Helm](https://helm.sh/) must be installed to use the charts. Please refer to Helm's [documentation](https://helm.sh/docs/) to get started.

Once Helm is set up properly, add the repo as follows:

```console
helm repo add neuro https://neuro-inc.github.io/helm-charts
```

You can then run helm search repo neuro to see the charts.
